# 🤝 Contributing to Doodle Jump Game

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Doodle Jump Game. It's people like you that make Doodle Jump Game such a great game.

## 📜 Code of Conduct
We have a code of conduct in place. We expect everyone participating in the Doodle Jump Game community to abide by it. Please read Code of Conduct before contributing.

## 🐞 Bug Reports
A bug is a demonstrable problem caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or `development` branch in the repository.
3. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a reduced test case.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## 💡 Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## 👩‍💻 Pull Requests
Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g., implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise, you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

## 🔨 Setting Up Your Development Environment
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Make your changes and commit them to your forked repository.
4. Submit a pull request with a description of your changes.
